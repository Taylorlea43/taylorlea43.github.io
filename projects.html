            <h3>Video Game Project</h3>
            <p>I Collaborated with a team of other students using Git to merge code writing and fixing code in order to improve an existing video game written in java. I learned to use Agile and Scrum frameworks to ensure organization and simulate a workplace environment. The video game is a platform game where you are being chased through a zoo and try to save all of the animals from the evil zookeeper!

            <h3>Open Source SuppTrack Project</h3>
            <p>
                Using open source projects I taught myself to make an IOS app using xcode and swift UI. The app is called Supptrack and the goal is for users to be able to scann supplements and see if they are safe for either an NCAA athlete or member of the Military.
